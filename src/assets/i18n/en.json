    "WELCOME": "Welcome in the Ionic Location Based Augmented Reality app.",
    "AR_MODULES": "The app is an home made implementation of a location based AR that uses:<br><ul><li>device motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer),</li><li>global positioning system (gps)</li><li>a Rest service to retrieve a points of interest list (POI) to show.</li></ul><br>Motion sensors data is optimized using a complementary filter called Sensor Fusion; it consists of a typescript implementation of Paul Lawitzki's work explained at the link: <a href=\"http://plaw.info/articles/sensorfusion\" target=\"_system\">http://plaw.info/articles/sensorfusion</a>.<br><br>The Rest service is a simple GET call to retrieve user's nearby POIs. It takes user's latitude, longitude and a POI maximum radius as input parameters.<br><br>The app also includes a map to insert on touch some test markers at runtime with debug and test purposes only.",
    "GO_TO_ALGORITHM": "Go to the algorithm",
    "ALGORITHM_HEADER": "In this section there is the explaination of the app based algorithm.<br>All dev configurable values are setted in constants.ts (src/util directory). Rest call endpoint is setted there too, although the service is mocked using a file poi-list.json.<br>The deployment machine baseUrl of the service is cofigured in the environment.ts and environment.prod.ts files (the last one is used with --prod flag Ionic execution). Here it is deactivable mock service execution too, switching mock flag to false.",
    "ALGORITHM_CONTENT": "<ol><li>Camera preview activation as view background, and camera field of view angle (FOV) retrieve.</li><li>Configurable costant frequency gps enabling, and enabling of sensor fusion service.</li><li>At the arrive of gps data, verify if it is included in a GPS_MIN_DISTANCE_FILTER meters radius. If true, execution of Rest call to retrieve POIs. For each POI included in a RADAR_POI_RADIUS meter user radius, distance and bearing informations are calculated and inserted in a pin array.</li><li>When fusion sensors data is available, for each pin included in the camera Field Of View (FOV), some on screen displacement infos are calculated and inserted in a spot array.</li><li>Each spot of the spot array is drawn on the view as camera background overlay</li></ol>"
